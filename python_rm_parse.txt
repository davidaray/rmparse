Take in a RepeatMasker output file and perform the following manipulations:

1. Convert to bed format with the following columns.
	A - chrom/contig/scaffold
	B - chromStart
	C - chromEnd
	D - TE name
	E - TE Class/Family
	F - size of TE insertion in bp
	G - K2P distance (without "kimura =")

2. Parse the output into six subcategory files: SINEs, Rolling Circle transposons (DNA/RC), DNA transposons (DNA/<anything other than RC>), NonLTR elements, LTR elements, unknowns.
	i.e. SINEs_rm.out, RC_rm.out, etc.
	
input file = aVan_rm.out
