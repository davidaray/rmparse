Take in a RepeatMasker output file and perform the following manipulations:

1. Convert to bed format with the following columns.
	A - chrom/contig/scaffold
	B - chromStart
	C - chromEnd
	D - TE name
	E - TE Class/Family
	F - strand (+/- instead of +/C)
	G - size of TE insertion in bp
	H - K2P distance (without "kimura =")

2. Parse the output into six subcategory files: SINEs, Rolling Circle transposons (DNA/RC), DNA transposons (DNA/<anything other than RC>), NonLTR elements, LTR elements, unknowns.
	i.e. SINEs_rm.out, RC_rm.out, etc.
	
input file = aVan_rm.out


Pseudocode
Gotta get rid of the header lines 
Initialize a list to store your data in
Open the file for reading
Read in your data line-by line from the file, leaving out the first three lines
Replace the / with tabs in each line as you read it in. Could also replace kimura= at this point.
Save that list to a new file 

Read in the new file as a pandas dataframe, naming the columns so that they are easy to manipulate.
Do the math to calculate the values for a new column, size. 
Rearrange the columns
Replace what needs to be replaced C for - and kimura= for nothing
Output everything to a new file
Delete the old 'new' file
